# Prediction-of-Stock-Prices-using-LSTM

One form of recurrent neural network used to learn order dependency in sequence prediction issues is called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The LSTM is particularly effective at forecasting stock prices because it can store historical data. This is so that future stock price predictions may be made as they are based on historical prices.
